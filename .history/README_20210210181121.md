# Portfolio Horizontal

## Presentation 

Hello ! You arrived on my git repo of my portfolio! This is version 2, in full horizontal!
I created this portfolio to increase my skills on the pure front, without framework, just HTML / CSS and JS.
I was inspired by a lot of tutorials, doc, and helped by very nice little Js libraries!
Enjoy!
## Univers

I wanted to set up a fairly "classy" theme, with primary colors (black, white and gold) to remain sober but at the same time original. I love horizontal sites, initially I was on a classic portfolio (V1) in react, and I fell for the horizontal with Locomotiv Scroll!

## Stack

I made the choice to use only the native to detach myself from the frameworks that I use daily. It allowed me to improve in Css / Js and to review some basics. Obviously, to have a nice rendering, the use of libraries is very practical!
## Library Js

Mainly Locomotiv Scroll which allows horizontal scrolling + titles animations. Gsap for the personalized cursor, then some props in css for the various animations (hovering images, stack items ...)
## Others

If you like my site, don't hesitate to share it around you and on your networks.
*I grant reuse (by not copying the site features for features anyway ...)
Of course, citing the source.*

Yours truly,

Romain ✌️
